# Description of Analysis Code

### Usage

Raw data is loaded from the Government of B.C. Data Catalogue using the R package `rems`
https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-environmental-monitoring-system-results 

There are five core scripts that are required for this water quality characterization; they need to be run in order:

- 01_load_ems_data.R
- 02_clean_calc_WQG.R
- 03_initial_vis.R
- 04_table_output.R
- 05_plot_output.R
